This repo contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The `greeter` function expects a string as input but is called with an array of strings.  The solution shows how to correctly handle the input to avoid this error.  This example highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and demonstrates how to correctly handle different data types in function parameters.
